      <h2>Built for Synology Photos</h2>
      <p>
        Cull Pilot is a browser extension that adds fast, keyboard-driven controls to the Synology Photos web interface. Star images, navigate albums, and curate selections without ever touching the mouse.

      <h2>Efficient by Design</h2>
      <p>
        Cull Pilot is inspired by Vim—its keyboard controls are designed for speed and muscle memory. Press <code>i</code> to enter insert mode, then use <code>1–5</code> to rate, <code>h</code> and <code>l</code> to navigate, and <code>Esc</code> to exit.

      <h2>For Pros and Newcomers Alike</h2>
      <p>
        If you're already familiar with star ratings from tools like Lightroom or photo metadata (EXIF), Cull Pilot gives you a faster way to apply those ratings directly from the Synology web app. Your existing workflows stay intact—you’re just moving faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're new to the concept: star ratings in Synology Photos can be used to automatically build albums based on criteria like “4 stars and up” or “rated within the last month.” With Cull Pilot, you can build these albums quickly by starring images directly while reviewing them.

      <h2>What It Does</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Star images using keys <code>0</code> through <code>5</code></li>
        <li>Clear a rating by pressing the same number twice or using <code>0</code></li>
        <li>Navigate between photos using <code>h</code> and <code>l</code></li>
        <li>Overlay shows active mode and feedback without interfering</li>
        <li>Works entirely in the lightbox view—no need to click the info panel</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Open Source and Transparent</h2>
      <p>
        Cull Pilot is open source and built for clarity, speed, and trust. You can inspect the code, suggest features, or contribute directly via GitHub.
